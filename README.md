# Getting Started

To get started, you need to take a link to the project on github and clone it to your device with a team:

git clone https://github.com/SnezhkoAndrey/TestAppSpaceScutum.git

# Open project

Next, you need to install all the installed packages and run the project in Docker with the command:

docker-compose up --build

Now you can open the project through Docker or use http://localhost:4000/ in your browser

Thank you for your attention and have a nice day!
